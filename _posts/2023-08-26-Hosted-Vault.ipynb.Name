    "> In this expanded Mind Map, we went into even more detail about the cost benefits of incorporating the provided features for small and medium-sized businesses. We started by expanding the nodes related to improved security posture, including more specific benefits such as protection of sensitive data and assets, prevention of cyber attacks and hacking attempts, and enhanced security controls and policies. We also added nodes related to regulatory compliance, including specific regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI-DSS, and highlighted the benefits of avoiding regulatory fines and sanctions and protecting sensitive data and customer privacy.\n",
    "> We expanded the nodes related to increased efficiency and productivity to include more specific benefits such as automated credential management and rotation, streamlined database and system access, and improved disaster recovery and business continuity. We also added nodes related to employee productivity and collaboration, including reduced time spent on manual tasks, improved collaboration and communication, and increased employee satisfaction and retention.\n",
    "> The nodes related to competitive advantage were expanded to include more specific benefits such as increased customer loyalty and retention, improved brand image and perception, and increased market share and revenue. We also added a new node related to the ability to bid for contracts that require advanced security measures, highlighting the benefits of access to more lucrative contracts and opportunities and differentiation from competitors.\n",
    "> The nodes related to cost savings were expanded to include more specific benefits such as reduced hardware and software costs, lower IT and legal fees, and lower insurance premiums. We also added nodes related to scalability, including the benefits of enhanced security and risk management capabilities, improved system performance and reliability, and reduced time and cost spent on manual tasks.\n",
    "> Finally, we expanded the nodes related to ease of use and implementation to include more specific benefits such as reduced training time and costs, faster time-to-market for new products and services, and improved resource allocation and productivity. We also added a new node related to integration with existing systems and tools, highlighting the benefits of reduced need for system upgrades and replacements, simplified IT infrastructure and management, and improved overall security posture and risk management. Overall, this Mind Map provides a comprehensive overview of the cost benefits that small and medium-sized businesses can achieve by incorporating the provided features."
