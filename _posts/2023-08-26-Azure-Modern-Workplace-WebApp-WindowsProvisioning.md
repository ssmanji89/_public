What is PlantUML code; also what is a MindMap? 

Return examples using the previously provided, return MindMap(s) using PlantUML provided both sets of information below (Windows Provisioning Package and Workflow for an Cloud Native Application using Azure)

Provided below is the Workflow for an Cloud Native Application using Azure:
Web app. A typical modern application might include both a website and one or more RESTful web APIs. A web API might be consumed by browser clients through AJAX, by native client applications, or by server-side applications. For considerations on designing web APIs, see API design guidance.
Front Door. Front Door is a layer 7 load balancer. In this architecture, it routes HTTP requests to the web front end. Front Door also provides a web application firewall (WAF) that protects the application from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Front Door is also used for a Content Delivery Network (CDN) solution in this design.
Function App. Use Function Apps to run background tasks. Functions are invoked by a trigger, such as a timer event or a message being placed on queue. For long-running stateful tasks, use Durable Functions.
Queue. In the architecture shown here, the application queues background tasks by putting a message onto an Azure Service Bus queue. The message triggers a function app. Alternatively, you can use Azure Storage queues. For a comparison, see Storage queues and Service Bus queues - compared and contrasted.
Cache. Store semi-static data in Azure Cache for Redis.
Data storage. Use Azure SQL Database for relational data. For non-relational data, consider Azure Cosmos DB.
Azure Cognitive Search. Use Azure Cognitive Search to add search functionality such as search suggestions, fuzzy search, and language-specific search. Azure Search is typically used in conjunction with another data store, especially if the primary data store requires strict consistency. In this approach, store authoritative data in the other data store and the search index in Azure Search. Azure Search can also be used to consolidate a single search index from multiple data stores.
Azure DNS. Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains, providing name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.
