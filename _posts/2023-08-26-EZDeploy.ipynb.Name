    "PowerShell: A command-line shell and scripting language that's built specifically for Windows environments. PowerShell includes a wide range of cmdlets for managing and provisioning Windows components, making it a natural choice for building provisioning scripts and automation workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    ".NET: As a Microsoft technology, .NET includes a wide range of libraries and tools for building Windows applications, including applications that handle provisioning tasks. You can use .NET to build PowerShell modules or C# executables that assemble and deploy Provisioning Packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python: Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that includes a range of libraries and frameworks for automation and scripting. You can use Python to build PowerShell scripts, or to build Python executables that interact with the Provisioning Package API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC): DSC is a configuration management platform that enables you to declaratively specify the state of your Windows environments. You can use DSC to create and apply configurations that include Provisioning Packages as part of the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. By leveraging Kubernetes, you can build a cloud-native application that is highly scalable and resilient, and that can be easily deployed and managed across a variety of environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker: Docker is an open-source containerization platform that enables you to package your applications into containers that can be easily deployed and run in any environment. By using Docker, you can build a cloud-native application that is highly portable and that can be run on any infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that is optimized for building scalable and high-performance applications. By using Node.js, you can build a cloud-native application that can handle high traffic and that can be easily scaled horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    ".NET Core: .NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern applications. By using .NET Core, you can build a cloud-native application that can run on any platform and that can be easily scaled to handle increasing demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python: Python is a popular programming language for building cloud-native applications due to its simplicity, ease of use, and the wide range of libraries and frameworks available for building web applications, data processing applications, and machine learning applications.
